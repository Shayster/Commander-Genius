                <p>
                    All current versions are now stable, this doesn't mean perfect, just
                    good enough. The stable version is
                    known to work on most of the systems and has been tested deeper. The
                    Prereleases are known to be stable too, but with minor issues.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can also browse through the Sourceforge.net packages <a href= "https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=249154">here</a>.
                    They may not be the most stable versions, but they are more recent. If
                    you find bugs in them we would be happy if you report
                    them to us so we can improve Commander Genius.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you want the most recent source code you can also download it per GIT <a href= "http://sourceforge.net/scm/?type=git&group_id=249154">here</a>
                </p>

                <h1>Bugs found?</h1>
                <p>
                    We are happy to see people who test our product. If you want to report bugs, you can
                    do that <a href= "http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/clonekeenplus/">here</a>. This is mainly used by our developers but
                    can be used by everybody.

                <p>
                    The High Quality Pack provides extra resources for Commander
                    Genius like music and extra sound effects and svga graphics. When
                    installed, you can hear music in the first episode of the game. High
                    quality SVGA tilesets have been added to Episode 1 &amp; 2.
                    More is about to come!
                </p>
                <p>Try it out! It really makes an old game look great!</p>

                <p>
                    If you don't own any Commander Keen game, you will need
                    one to get the interpreter run. If you own one or the
                    trilogy, you can use them. This is the original
                    DOS-Version of Commander Keen Episode 1 (Shareware).
                    The bundle versions have included this episode already,
                    so no download needed for those.
