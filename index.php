                <h2>Welcome to Commander Genius</h2>
                <p>
                    Commander Genius, also known as CloneKeen Plus, is an
                    engine which interprets the Commander Keen Invasion of
                    the Vorticons series. As fans and developers, we try to
                    implement new features, improve the gameplay, and give
                    players an experience that feels like playing the
                    original game. You will also need the original game
                    files in addition to Commander Genius. Commander Keen:
                    Marooned on Mars is shareware and may be freely, and
                    legally downloaded elsewhere. Commander Keen: The Earth
                    Explodes and Commander Keen: Keen Must Die! are
                    registered versions which can be purchased from 3D
                    Realms, Apogee, or purchased from someone willing to
                    sell you their copy. If you still have these old games,
                    then give Commander Genius a try! You will be surprised
                    at how good they look and how much fun they are to play!

                    The right hand image that you see is Commander Keen in
                    a dark room when playing the game normally under DOS
                    (or for example DOS-Box). To the left you see the room
                    using Commander Genius. Quite the difference, huh?! The
                    darkness depends on the difficulty, so watch your step.
                    ;-)
